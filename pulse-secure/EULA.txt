d. Indemnification. Pulse Secure shall defend and indemnify You, at its own expense, from any suit brought against You based upon a claim that the Software infringes any third party trade name, patent or copyright (“IP Claims”) and will pay all damages and costs that a court awards against You as a result of such claim, provided that You: (i) promptly give Pulse Secure written notice of such IP Claim after becoming aware of it and furnish Pulse Secure with a copy of each communication, notice or other document exchanged with the claimant relating to the IP Claim; (ii) give Pulse Secure complete control of the defense and settlement of the IP Claim; and (iii) fully cooperate with Pulse Secure in the defense or settlement of such claim.
